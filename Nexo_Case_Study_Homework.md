# HOW CRYPTO-BACKED LOANS ARE RESHAPING THE LENDING MARKET & CRYPTO SPACE

## Overview and Origin

* Nexo

* Nexo was a European lender for 10 years before launching the first instant, crypto-backed lending platform on April 2018 *Coinmarketcap*

* Kosta Kantchev, Antoni Trenchev, Georgi Shulev *crunchbase*

* Three financial professionals and crypto enthusiasts wanted to create the blockchain equivalent of a lending platform. Widely available in traditional finance, crypto lending was and still is a relatively new concept. In launching Nexo, they carved out their own crypto lending niche. *Coinmarketcap*

* $52.5M has been funded through debt financing. *crunchbase*


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

The primary concern for crypto investors is having to sell assets to free up capital. However, in doing so there are two issues that arise. First, selling a crypto asset creates a taxable event. Second, the investor may miss out on future asset appreciation by selling a crypto asset. Nexo offers instant crypto-backed loans so that investors can free up capital without having to sell any assets. Moreover, at significantly lower interest rates, crypto-backed lending can be much more attractive than traditional lending options. Customers can quickly raise capital without any delays or credit checks because the loans are collateralized by the borrowers’ assets.

* Who is the company's intended customer?

Nexo’s primary customers are retail and institutional crypto investors.

Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

“According to PointPay, the market for crypto loans, where bitcoin and stablecoins are pledged as collateral, is estimated at approximately $ 30-35 billion in 2021 - and it continues to grow.” – Published April 8th, 2021, EIN Presswire 

What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Nexo’s primary competitive advantage is instant, crypto-backed loans. Secondly, their aggressive yields they offer customers for holding assets on the Nexo platform are some of the highest in the industry. There are more and more competitors in this space every day, however, they maintain their advantage by paying out daily compounding interest, maintaining healthy Loan-To-Value (LTV) ratios, and offer no-fee asset swaps. Their lending rates and yields are tiered based on the amount of the Nexo token a customer holds. 
Nexo allows customers to continue to earn interest on crypto that is used as collateral for loans which is another great benefit to using Nexo. Furthermore, this feature is not widely available across all lending platforms. 

Lastly, Nexo’s loan minimums make their services more widely available than other lenders in this space. This means their loans provide more access to more people.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

JavaScript, AJAX, HTML, CSS, SASS, XML, Android, Xcode, AWS, Python, SQL, Nginx, PHP, MongoDB, MySQL, Node, npm
The above languages and technologies are being used to continue to develop and integrate their platform on both desktop and mobile applications. 
The following is an excerpt from CoinMarketCap which outlines the underlying process to automate their lending process.
“Its automated lending process uses smart contracts and an oracle on the Ethereum blockchain to manage loans. After a user transfers cryptocurrency to a Nexo-controlled wallet, the oracle establishes the loan and the user is instantly allocated the funds. When the user makes a deposit in order to repay the loan, the oracle returns the cryptocurrency and records the transaction on the blockchain. Smart contracts are used to power NEXO and to record user balances.” - Coinmarketcap

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

Crypto Lending – Instant, Crypto-Backed Loans

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

Crypto lending in and of itself is innovative. Because it is new it is constantly evolving. It is so valuable not just for the developed world but for 30% of the population that is unbanked. If you can access the internet, you can set up an account and start trading crypto. Furthermore, with no credit checks, no minimum payments, penalties (i.e. late or early repayments), and minimal terms almost anyone could use their crypto to take a loan out. This means capital is more widely available to those underserved.

In the developed world where millions of people are struggling financially, the ability get a loan without credit is a significant innovation. Furthermore, companies avoid any issues of discrimination since the only requirements are the assets that back the loan.

The concept of cold storage is another major innovation that more and more crypto lenders are leveraging as security is a major concern for crypto investors. Cold storage minimizes the risk of assets being stolen. 

The combination of industry volatility and automation makes crypto-backed lending a very progressive concept. With the amount of volatility associated with crypto assets and the automation of technologies, users can protect their investments while continuing to realize the upside. Automation helps avoid loan delinquency because should an asset drop in value, crypto lending companies have processes in place to ensure the minimum Loan-to-value (LTV) ratio is maintained. If there is a risk that there isn’t enough in the account to maintain a minimum LTV ratio they alert the customers to add additional value to the account.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

In just three short years Nexo has built a user base of over 2 million users. They offer over 40 different currencies to exchange and yield interest.

In December 2020, Nexo announced Nexonomics, “a complete overhaul of the Nexo tokenomics”. Specifically, they outlined a buyback program: “The company’s Board of Directors approved an initial repurchase of $12 million of its NEXO Token on an open-market principle, with the decision coming into force with immediate effect”. Additionally, “The launch of a $12 million Buyback program under Nexonomics further bolstered NEXO Token holders’ returns, also ensuring the token price continuously reflects its true underlying value and Nexo’s firm belief in its worth. Per the program, 1,482,207.9472 NEXO Tokens have already been repurchased at prices ranging between $0.43 and $0.60 apiece. The buyback offsets market volatility and improves the stability of the NEXO Token’s price, significantly decreasing risks for investors and avoiding undervaluation of the asset.” - Press Release published December 3rd, 2020

On February 1st, 2021, Nexo announced and deployed swap functionality into their application features. This was a big step towards offering an exchange as Nexo was primarily a yield bearing wallet. This allows customers swap out different assets in real-time with no fees. While initially they only offered a small amount of assets on the platform, they are continually adding new assets every month. Since this announcement they have added an additional five crypto assets.

In June of 2021, they had their first governance vote which was a big deal because the vote was to let customers decide if they wanted to continue with the annual dividend Nexo offered or to switch over to a daily interest payout on the Nexo token. Additionally, this was important because paying out dividends makes the United States regulators view the Nexo token as a security. This withheld significant opportunities for U.S. based Nexo customers to earn passive income on the Nexo token.

The community voted to change the annual dividend to daily interest payouts which means the Nexo token became a utility token. Furthermore, any customers holding the Nexo token can now earn daily interest regardless of where they are located.

While many crypto companies offer referral programs, they only recently rolled out their own customer referral program. Their focus has been and continues to be bringing more assets to and building the platform to offer more functionality.

While Nexo is a smaller lender in the market their growth cannot be ignored. They continue to innovate and build out the platform to maintain a competitive edge.


* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

Metrics – Nexo Performance

Number of users – 2M
Number of Currencies - 40
Number of Crypto Assets - 16
Assets Under Management (AUM) - $4B
Insurance - $375 million insurance on custodial assets through BitGo

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Nexo is a leader in crypto, however, they are not #1. This is likely because they did not raise as much funding as BlockFi or Celsius nor do they have all the features of a major exchange. There are a lot of benefits to being a customer of Nexo, but what holds them back are some limiting features which is changing. They only recently rolled out a swap feature in Q2. While BlockFi is much bigger, they started cutting rates along with other companies. The only financial changes Nexo made that negatively impacted customers were requiring slightly higher loan-to-value ratios. This is to accommodate for the significant influx of interest in the platform.

Zero-fee swapping of assets is another advantage Nexo offers. For example, while Celsius offers many more assets to earn yield with, they 1) have lower rates on many assets Nexo offers, and 2) are primarily a wallet with lending features but no exchange or swapping features. This is a drawback to Celsius as you have to move your assets to an exchange, incurring fees, in order to sell, swap, or exchange your assets. 

Celsius referral program is more attractive because they pay out $40 for each new customer you refer that deposits $400 in Celsius and recently increased their incentive payout to $50.

BlockFi, Celsius, and Nexo all provide similar offerings with their own respective advantages and drawbacks. However, Nexo offers the highest yields on assets. 

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers or use your imagination!)

I would recommend building a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) like the Binance Smart Chain. They could get into the cold storage market as that is still new. However, to stay competitive with the bigger exchanges I would recommend a DEX since hardware has it’s own drawbacks of associated inventory and overhead costs.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

Binance showed the world that it could compete in decentralized finance and the significant market it brought them. Creating a DEX would further support the utility of the Nexo token. It would grow their market share and mindshare of the average crypto investor. Furthermore, they could create other tokens with different purposes if they were to build their own DEX. 

They could essentially build out their own ecosystem like some of the other more widely known assets like Cardano, Solana, and Polkadot.

Decentralized finance is the future and building a DEX would solidify Nexo as a leader in the crypto space.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

With my limited knowledge of how DEXs are built, I want to say they would need to identify their own network standardization like ERC-20, TRC-20, or BEP2. Once identified they could start with a P2P framework or create a smart contract platform.

In building this technology they would need liquidity and to provide access to coins through, for example, a MetaMask integration. This may be the easiest as it is one of the most widely used hot wallets in the market available on both Android and iOS.

They should start with providing liquidity for ERC-20 and BEP2 tokens since they are the most widely sought after for exchanging.

They could use the following languages to start building. However, as they build they may realize they need to look at additional technologies or create their own proprietary framework or language.

•	JavaScript
•	Python
•	SQL
•	PHP

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

From a standardization perspective, these technologies can help them break into the DEX market. Once they build market share, they can evaluate building  their own ecosystem.
