# Nexo Case Study

This was the first homework assignment of the bootcamp. We had to pick a company to write a case study about their application of FinTech or Blockchain principles. I chose Nexo because I'm active investor in the platform and understand their business well. This assignment helped me understand any knowledge gaps I had with technology applications in real world companies. Furthermore, it reinforced my interest and enthusiasm around the future of blockchain technology.
